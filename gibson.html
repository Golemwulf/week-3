            The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with 
            sunburst finishes in 1958. The 1958â€“1960 sunburst Les Paul, today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world, was 
            considered a commercial failure,[citation needed] with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what 
            is now known as the Gibson SG. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has been 
            produced in many versions and editions since. Along with Fender's Telecaster and Stratocaster, it was one of the first mass-produced 
            electric solid-body guitars. Due to their versatility, Les Paul electric guitars have been used in a wide range of music genres, 
            including rock, country, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.

        <h3>Overall Design
        </h3>
        <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952.
             The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis and his team with input from and endorsement by guitarist Les Paul. 
             Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with 
             a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.</p>

        <p>A humbucker, humbucking pickup, or double coil, is a guitar pickup that uses two wire coils to cancel out noisy interference from 
            coil pickups. Humbucking coils are also used in dynamic microphones to cancel electromagnetic hum. Humbuckers are one of two main types of guitar Pickups
        </p>
        <p>
            Humbuckers work by pairing a coil that has the north poles of its magnets oriented "up" (toward the strings) with another coil alongside it with the 
            south pole of its magnets oriented up. By connecting the coils together out of phase, the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation: 
            the string signals from both coils add up instead of canceling because the magnets are placed in opposite polarity. This dramatically improves the 
            signal-to-noise ratio. The technique has something in common with what electrical engineers call "common-mode rejection", and is also found in the balanced 
            lines used in audio equipment. By convention, both humbucker coils are wound counterclockwise. The coils can be connected in series or in parallel in order 
            to achieve this hum-cancellation effect, but humbucker pickups tend to be connected in series because that doubles the signal of the strings while keeping the
             hum reduced. Some types of humbucker pickups can be manually split (with a switch or within the pickup selector) so that only one coil is active.
